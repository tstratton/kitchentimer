<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>What is Kitchen Timer (KT)?</h3>
<div>As its name suggests, it is a timer for cooking. In reality it contains three separate, independent timers that can be used for a lot more than just boiling an egg! Turn it on whenever you need to set a time limit of any kind (paid parking, training, taking a nap, etc.)..</div>
<div><br />
  </div>
<h3>How do I use Kitchen Timer?</h3>
<div>It's very simple: to set a desired time limit to count down from, use the three number boxes in the middle of the screen (respectively hours, minutes and seconds). There are two ways to set them:</div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>push the + and - buttons</li>
    <li>touch the numbers with your finger. This should bring up the keyboard so you can enter the values you want directly</li>
  </ul></div>
<div>Once you have selected a time, you need only press one of the three "Start" buttons on the bottom of the screen to get one of the three timers going.</div>
<h3>How can I stop the alarm?</h3>
<div>KT uses the Android notification system to sound the alarm. Therefore, to stop it you need only open the Android Notification Bar by touching it or swiping it down (usually this Notification Bar is situated at the top of the screen and contains the GSM signal strength, the charge level and the time).</div>
<div><br />
  </div>
<div>Another way to stop the alarm is to touch whichever of the three timers was last to complete its countdown.</div>
<div><br />
  </div>
<h3>Is it normal for the alarm not to go off when the phone is in silent mode?</h3>
<div>Yes, it's normal. As previously mentioned, KT uses the Android notification system to sound the alarm, so a phone in silent mode should not make any sound.</div>
<div><br />
  </div>
<h3>How can I change the name assigned to a Timer?</h3>
<div>Just touching the name of a particular timer brings up a window where you can alter the label. Selecting the "Default" button will reset the predefined name. The same options are available through the "Preferences" screen (MENU -> Preferences -> Set Timer Names).</div>
<div><br />
  </div>
<h3>How can I save my time settings for future use?</h3>
<div>KT automatically stores the last time inserted in a particular timer until the next time the application is launched. It is also possible to save times manually by making use of "Presets". Select the MENU key and click on "Presets". At this point, you can simply select a time, assign it a name, and press the "Save" button.</div>
<div><br />
  </div>
<h3>How can I use Presets?</h3>
<div>Once saved, a Preset can be recalled just by touching it (a short touch) in the "Presets" screen. This will load up the time. Now, all you have to do is press one of the three 'Start' buttons and the Preset timer name will be given to the corresponding timer.</div>
<div><br />
  </div>
<h3>How can I edit/delete a Preset?</h3>
<div>Long-pressing a Preset will bring up a menu containing the options "Edit" and "Delete".</div>
<div><br />
  </div>
<h3>How can I import Presets from, or export them to my device's SD card?</h3>
<div>Once you have entered the "Presets" screen, pressing the MENU button will bring up the "Import" and "Export" options.</div>
<div><br />
